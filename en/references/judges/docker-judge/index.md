# Docker judge

The Docker judge has 4 main functions:
1. Check usage of Docker instructions like `USER` or `WORKDIR` using [dodona-containerfile-evaluator](https://github.com/Bond-009/dodona-containerfile-evaluator).
2. Static analysis (linting) using [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) to annotate the code and optionally fail the solution if it contains errors.
3. Build the submitted Dockerfile using [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko).
4. Check the existence and/or contents of files and directories in the image that is build from the submitted Dockerfile.

Items 1 and 2 above are configurable.


## Configuring Docker instructions

Create a file called `judge.json` inside of the `evaluation` directory.
Using this file it's possible to verify the base image, the `from` object requires the `image` to contain the image name, optionally a `tag` or `hash` property can be added to check the used tag or digest.
It's also possible to check if the `USER` or `WORKDIR` instructions are used with the desired arguments.
Another feature is the ability to check if the comments contain certain strings using the `comments` array.
This file also contains a `files` property that is a JSON array of JSON objects.
Each object contains a `path` property with the desired location in the resulting image.
The object represents either a file or a directory, this is specified by the `type` property.
Additionally objects representing files can also contain a `compare` or `regex` property.
`compare` should be the name of a file inside of the `workdir` with which the file at `path` should be compared with.
`regex` contains a ("extended") "regular expression that should match on the content of the file at `path`.

An example `judge.json`:
```json
{
  "from": {
    "image": "alpine",
    "tag": "3:20"
  },
  "user": "runner",
  "workdir": "/course",
  "comments": [ "docker run" ],
  "files": [
    { "type": "directory", "path": "/course" },
    { "type": "file", "path": "/environment.yml", "compare": "environment.yml" },
    { "type": "directory", "path": "/usr/miniconda3/envs/pipeline-tools-1.0.0" },
    { "type": "file", "path": "/etc/os-release", "regex": "^ID=\"ubuntu\"$" }
  ]
}
```

## Configuring Hadolint

The behavior of Hadolint can be modified by creating a [Hadolint configuration file](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint#configure) with one of the following names inside of the `evaluation` directory: `.hadolint.yml`, `.hadolint.yaml`, `hadolint.yml` or `hadolint.yaml`.
Using this it's possible to change the severity of annotations, fail when a certain severity is hit, check if labels exist and more.

An example configuration file looks as follows:
```yml
no-fail: false
failure-threshold: error
label-schema:
  org.opencontainers.image.title: text
  org.opencontainers.image.description: text
  org.opencontainers.image.source: text
  org.opencontainers.image.revision: text
  org.opencontainers.image.licenses: text
  org.opencontainers.image.vendor: text
override:
  error:
    - DL3049
ignored:
  - DL3004
```

`no-fail` specifies if the judge should fail the solution if the linter fails.
`failure-threshold` sets the threshold for which rules will cause a fail, valid values are `error`, `warning`, `info` and `style`.
`label-schema` is a dictionary where the key is the label name and the value of a label can be either of `text`, `url`, `semver`, `hash`, `rfc3339`, `spdx` or `email`.
`override` is used to override the severity of rules, valid severities are the same as for `failure-threshold`.
`ignored` is a list or rules that should be ignored.
More configuration options can be found in the [Hadolint README](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint#configure)


## Limitations
Due to the design of the judge it isn't possible to test the existence of files if no `COPY`, `RUN` or `ADD` instructions are present in the final stage.
For example, if the following solution is submitted, a test for the existence of the file `/etc/os-release` which is present in the alpine base image will fail.
```docker
FROM alpine:3.21

USER runner

WORKDIR /home/runner

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="test"
```
But once you add one of the instructions that can modify the filesystem this same test will succeed.
