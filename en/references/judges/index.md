# Judges

On this page you can find an overview of all judges that are available on Dodona. A judge is a piece of software that is responsible for testing the solutions of students and writing the results in a format that Dodona understands.

Most judges only support one programming language, but there are also judges like [TESTed](#TESTed) that support multiple programming languages.

::: tip Recommended judge
If you're trying to decide which judge to use for your exercises, we strongly recommend taking a look at [TESTed](#tested) first.
:::

## C
C is a judge that uses the GTester framework to run tests on C exercises.\
**Programming languages:** C\
**Get started** [Documentation](https://github.com/mvdcamme/C-Judge), [examples](https://github.com/mvdcamme/C-Judge/tree/master/example_exercises) \
**Created by:** [Maarten Vandercammen](mailto:mvdcamme@vub.ac.be)

## Haskell
Haskell is a judge that uses HUnit to test Haskell exercises. \
**Programming languages:** Haskell\
**Get started** [Github repo](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-haskell), [examples](https://github.com/dodona-edu/example-exercises/tree/master/haskell) \
**Created by:** [Team Dodona](mailto:dodona@ugent.be)

## HTML
The HTML judge evaluates both the HTML and CSS code of a student, based on a model solution or a checklist of criteria.\
**Programming languages:** HTML, CSS\
**Get started** [Documentation](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-html), [examples](https://github.com/dodona-edu/example-exercises/tree/master/html) \
**Created by:** [Brecht Willems](mailto:Brecht.Willems@UGent.be)

## Java
The java judge uses the JUnit4 framework to run tests on Java exercises.\
**Programming languages:** Java\
**Get started** [Documentation](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-java), [examples](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-java/tree/master/examples) \
**Created by:** [Team Dodona](mailto:dodona@ugent.be)

## Markdown
The markdown judge is not a real judge as it does not evaluate code.
It does render the Markdown code of a student and can be useful to manually evaluate the output in Dodona.\
**Programming languages:** Markdown\
**Get started** [Documentation](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-markdown) \
**Created by:** [Team Dodona](mailto:dodona@ugent.be)

## Nextflow
The Nextflow judge uses CodeNarc to lint workflows and also checks the existence of produced files.\
**Programming languages:** Nextflow\
**Get started** [Git repo](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-nextflow), [examples](https://github.com/Bond-009/dodona-nextflow-exercises) \
**Created by:** [Lode Willems](mailto:bits@vib.be)

## Prolog
Prolog is a judge that can be used for exercises on the Prolog programming language.
It supports PLUnit, QuickCheck and simple input output tests.\
**Programming languages:** Prolog\
**Get started** [Documentation](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-prolog), [examples](https://github.com/dodona-edu/example-exercises/tree/master/prolog) \
**Created by:** [Team Dodona](mailto:dodona@ugent.be)

## R
R is a judge that can be used for exercises on the R programming language.\
**Programming languages:** R\

**Created by:** [Team Dodona](mailto:dodona@ugent.be)

## Scheme
Scheme is a judge that supports the `R5RS` variant of the scheme programming language. It uses a custom testframework [dunit](https://gitlab.soft.vub.ac.be/Structuur1/dodona-judge/-/tree/master/collects/dunit) to define the tests.\
**Programming languages:** Scheme\
**Get started** [Documentation](https://gitlab.soft.vub.ac.be/Structuur1/dodona-judge), [examples](https://gitlab.soft.vub.ac.be/Structuur1/dodona-judge/-/tree/master/example-exercises) \
**Created by:** [Mathijs Saey](mailto:scpi@dinf.vub.ac.be)

## SQL
The SQL judge supports both query evaluation (DML) and structural database building (DDL).\
**Programming languages:** SQL\
**Get started** [Documentation](https://github.com/dodona-edu/judge-sql), [examples](https://github.com/dodona-edu/example-exercises/tree/master/sql) \
**Created by:** [Brecht Willems](mailto:Brecht.Willems@UGent.be)

## TESTed
This judge is recommended by the Dodona team.
TESTed is a judge that can be used for multiple programming languages.
It uses a simple custom test format, that is independent of the programming language of the exercise.\
**Programming languages:** Bash, C, C#, C++, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Typescript, Kotlin, Python\
**Get started** [Documentation](/en/guides/exercises/), [examples](https://github.com/dodona-edu/example-exercises/tree/master/tested) \
