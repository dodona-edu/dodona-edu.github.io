# Repository directory structure

A repository directory contains a collection of exercises. We expect this repository directory to have a specific structure:

- **A `dirconfig.json` file**: this file contains the [repository-wide configuration](/en/references/exercise-config). This configuration will be merged with the `config.json` file in an exercise's directory. These values can be overridden by the config files in the lower directory.
- **A `public` directory**: this directory contains files that can be used anywhere in Dodona:
You can add pictures or other resources that can then be referred to in the description of the course or a series. The URL to these files can be found on the repository page on Dodona. These are public elements, so these files should not be confidential.
- **A `media` directory**: this directory contains media files that can be used in all exercise descriptions in that repository only. Dodona will automatically fallback to this folder if a media item is referred to but not found in the `media` directory of the exercise it was used in.
- **Optionally multiple `exercise` directories**: these directories contain the information for the individual exercises. For more information regarding their structure, please see the [exercise directory structure page](/en/references/exercise-directory-structure).

Dodona ignores other files and directories. You can thus freely create additional files (for example, containing the solutions to your exercises) or create a personal exercise hierarchy. The only thing that isn't allowed is placing exercise directories inside other exercise directories.

## Example of a valid repository structure

::: tip Examples
Take a look at the [example exercises repository](https://github.com/dodona-edu/example-exercises) and [example course](https://dodona.ugent.be/en/courses/358/) to see some examples of a valid repository structure.
