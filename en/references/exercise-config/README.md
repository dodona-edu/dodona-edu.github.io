# Exercise configuration

Dodona allows setting the configuration of an **exercise** and a **reading activity** using config files. These files are in the JSON format and must be named `config.json` in exercise directories and `dirconfig.json` for other directories. To determine the final config values for a learning activity, Dodona merges the default config file with the dirconfigs in the parent directories of the exercise and with the exercise config. Merging happens in such a way that you can always override values set in a parent directory.

## Config file structure for exercises

- **`type`**: Must be set to `exercise` for exercises. Defaults to `exercise` if not present.
- **`programming_language`** (string): the programming language of the exercise, used for syntax highlighting and correct file extensions
- **`access`** (`public` or `private`): determines who can use this exercise
  - `public`: any other teacher on Dodona can use this exercise
  - `private`: only teachers with explicit permission can use this exercise
- **`description`** (object): the specification of the description of the exercise
  - **`names`** (object): the name of the exercise
    - **`nl`**: the name of the exercise in Dutch
    - **`en`**: the name of the exercise in English
- **`evaluation`**: the specification of the evaluation procedure
  - **`handler`** (string, optional): the name of the judge that is used for evaluation. By default, Dodona uses the judge specified for the repository.
  - **`image`** (string, optional): the name of the docker image that is used for evaluation. By default, Dodona uses the image specified by the judge.
  - **`time_limit`** (integer, optional): the time in seconds before the evaluations times out. By default, the limit is 42 seconds.
  - **`memory_limit`** (integer, optional): the amount of memory in bytes that is available for running the evaluation. By default, the limit is 100MB.
  - **`network_enabled`** (boolean, optional): set to `true` if internet access should be enabled. This optional setting is `false` by default.
- **`labels`** (array of strings, optional): a list of labels that can be used to search for this exercise using the Dodona web interface.
- **`contact`** (string, optional): info about the author of this exercise, formatted like an email To header.

## Config file structure for reading activities

The structure for a reading activity is identical to that of an exercise. There are 2 big differences: the value of `type` must be set to `content` and keys that are not relevant for exercises can be omitted. The format of the description is also identical.

- **`type`**: Must be set to `content` for reading activities
- **`access`** (`public` or `private`): determines who can use this exercise
  - `public`: any other teacher on Dodona can use this exercise
  - `private`: only teachers with explicit permission can use this exercise
- **`description`** (object): the specification of the description of the exercise
  - **`names`** (object): the name of the exercise
    - **`nl`**: the name of the exercise in Dutch
    - **`en`**: the name of the exercise in English
- **`labels`** (array of strings, optional): a list of labels that can be used to search for this exercise using the Dodona web interface.
- **`contact`** (string, optional): info about the author of this reading activity, formatted like an email To header.
