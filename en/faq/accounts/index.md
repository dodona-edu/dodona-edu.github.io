# FAQ: Accounts and settings

## How do accounts work on Dodona?

Accounts on Dodona are automatically created when you log in for the first time. You can log in with your institutional account (e.g. UGent, Smartschool, ...) or with a personal account (e.g. Google, Microsoft, ...). If you use an institutional account, your account is automatically linked to your school or university.

It is not possible to manually create an account on Dodona with a username and password.

## I work in several schools, how does this work?

Your account on Dodona is linked to the way you log in. For example, if you have Smartschool accounts at several schools, each of them will be linked to a different Dodona account.

## I get an error about linked accounts when I try to sign in, what should I do?

Your Dodona account is linked to the way you log in. However, some schools use more than one way to log in. For example, they have both Smartschool and Microsoft 365. To prevent students from these schools from ending up with multiple accounts on Dodona, we can (manually) link multiple sign-in methods to a single school.

When you sign in for the first time, we will check if your school already has an account with the same name or email that used a different login method. If this is the case, we will try to link the two accounts. To do this, you will need to confirm your identity using the original sign-in method.

## I have created a course for my students, but only some of them can see it. What is going on?

If you limit the visibility of your course to a specific school, only students from that school will be able to see your course. If one of your students can't see your course, it's probably because their account is not correctly linked to their school. This can happen for two reasons:

- They have signed in with a personal Google or Microsoft account instead of their institutional account. In this case, they should log out and log in again with their institutional account.

- Your school has multiple authentication methods (e.g. Smartschool and Microsoft 365) and Dodona thinks they are different schools. In this case, you should contact us to manually merge the two authentication methods for your school. Use the contact form at [dodona.be/en/contact](https://dodona.be/en/contact) to contact us.

## My name or email is wrong, how can I change it?

Dodona automatically gets your name and email from the login provider (e.g. Smartschool) when you log in. If you want to change your name or email, you should change it in Smartschool (or your other login provider). The next time you log in, Dodona will automatically update your name and email.

## I get a warning that my time zone is wrong, what should I do?

All deadlines on Dodona are displayed in your local time. To do this, Dodona needs to associate a time zone with your account. If we detect that the timezone of your browser is different from the timezone of your account, we will show a warning. You can change your timezone in your [Account Settings](https://dodona.ugent.be/en/profile).
