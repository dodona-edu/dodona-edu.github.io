## What is Dodona?

Dodona is an online exercise platform for learning to code. The web application was developed at Ghent University to support practical sessions for large groups of students.

Currently, Dodona supports more than 20 programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, C#, bash, Prolog, Haskell, sql and R.

* The second part, [Courses on Dodona](../courses/), discusses how to register to and unsubscribe from a course, how to navigate to a course, and how to interpret the submission status.
* The last part, [Solving Exercises](../exercises/), contains all the information related to navigating to exercises or submissions, submitting solutions, and interpreting feedback.
