# Getting started with Dodona

Welcome to the Dodona guides.

## What is Dodona?

Dodona is an online exercise platform for learning to code.
It wants to teach students how to program in the most meaningful and effective way possible. Dodona acts as an online co-teacher, designed to give every student access to high-quality education.
The focus is on automatic corrections and giving meaningful feedback on the submitted solutions from students.
At the moment, Dodona supports more than 20 programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, C#, C++, bash, Prolog, Haskell, sql and R.

Depending on your role, we have a specific guide for you:
