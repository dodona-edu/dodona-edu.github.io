# Creating Exercises: Writing the Assignment and Test Suite

If you used the _template repository_ in the previous step of the guide, your repository already contains an exercise (_EchoFunction_).
Now, we will add another exercise ourselves.
The existing exercise can, of course, serve as an example.

::: info Creating Files and Folders
1. Select the folder where you want to create the file or folder.
2. Use the icons at the top to create a file or folder. You can also right-click on the folder and choose `New File...` or `New Folder...`.
3. Type the name of the file (including the extension) or folder. Preferably, choose a name without spaces.
4. Confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

<!--@include: ../../examples/_common.md-->

## 5. Saving Changes

Now that the exercise is ready, we need to save the changes to the repository (that means _committing_ the changes in the repo).
Do this as follows:

![commit window](./commit.png)

1. Click on the _Source Control_ icon on the left.
2. At the top of the list of changes, click the `+` button to stage all files (_Stage All Changes_).
3. Enter a _commit message_ at the top. Describe what you have done, such as "Add my first exercise".
4. Click the `Commit & Push` button. If you get a pop-up, choose `Sync (Push & Pull)`.

If everything went well, this window should now be empty.

## 6. Testing the Exercise

The exercise you just created can be found in [your exercise repository](https://dodona.be/en/repositories/) on Dodona.
Your new exercise is now available as a _concept_ on Dodona.

Before you can publish an exercise (removing it from concept status), Dodona checks whether three conditions are met:

- The exercise must have a valid configuration file.
- The exercise must have a name and description.
- You must submit at least one correct solution.

If you followed this guide, the first two conditions are already met.
You only need to submit a correct solution, which we have already created.
To do this, click on the info icon in the top menu bar:

![Sample Solution](./sample-solution.png)

Next, select the sample solution you want to submit (in this case, there is only one: `solution.py`), then click the _Submit this solution_ button.
This will open the exercise page with the sample solution preloaded.
All you need to do is click submit.

![Select Sample Solution](./dodona-submit.png)

Once the solution is marked as correct, you will be able to publish the exercise by clicking _Publish this exercise_.
Your exercise is now ready to use on Dodona!

::: tip
Let someone else try your exercise. This often helps you discover gaps in the test suite and refine the exercise further.
